# Browser Game & Social Network

## Overview

This is a single-page application website made with React that allows users to sign in and play a 'choose-your-path' browser game.
The app also includes a functional lobby where users can find other users, befriend each other, and chat globally or privately.
At the game's prologue the player is asked a few questions, and the answers given determine the stats of the new character.

Note: The app is optimized for desktop full-screen.
